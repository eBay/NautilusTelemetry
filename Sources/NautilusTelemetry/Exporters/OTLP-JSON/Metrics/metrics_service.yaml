    v1AggregationTemporality:
      type: string
      description: |-
        AggregationTemporality defines how a metric aggregator reports aggregated
        values. It describes how those values relate to the time interval over
        which they are aggregated.

         - AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_UNSPECIFIED: UNSPECIFIED is the default AggregationTemporality, it MUST not be used.
         - AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_DELTA: DELTA is an AggregationTemporality for a metric aggregator which reports
        changes since last report time. Successive metrics contain aggregation of
        values from continuous and non-overlapping intervals.

        The values for a DELTA metric are based only on the time interval
        associated with one measurement cycle. There is no dependency on
        previous measurements like is the case for CUMULATIVE metrics.

        For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
        it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
        DELTA metric:

          1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.
          2. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          3. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          4. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          5. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
             number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
             t_0+1 with a value of 3.
          6. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          7. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          8. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
             number of requests received over the interval of time t_0+1 to
             t_0+2 with a value of 2.
         - AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_CUMULATIVE: CUMULATIVE is an AggregationTemporality for a metric aggregator which
        reports changes since a fixed start time. This means that current values
        of a CUMULATIVE metric depend on all previous measurements since the
        start time. Because of this, the sender is required to retain this state
        in some form. If this state is lost or invalidated, the CUMULATIVE metric
        values MUST be reset and a new fixed start time following the last
        reported measurement time sent MUST be used.

        For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
        it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
        CUMULATIVE metric:

          1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.
          2. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          3. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          4. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          5. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
             number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
             t_0+1 with a value of 3.
          6. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          7. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          8. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
             number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
             t_0+2 with a value of 5.
          9. The system experiences a fault and loses state.
          10. The system recovers and resumes receiving at time=t_1.
          11. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
          12. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
             number of requests received over the interval of time t_1 to
             t_0+1 with a value of 1.

        Note: Even though, when reporting changes since last report time, using
        CUMULATIVE is valid, it is not recommended. This may cause problems for
        systems that do not use start_time to determine when the aggregation
        value was reset (e.g. Prometheus).

        HistogramDataPoint is a single data point in a timeseries that describes the
        time-varying values of a Histogram. A Histogram contains summary statistics
        for a population of values, it may optionally contain the distribution of
        those values across a set of buckets.

        If the histogram contains the distribution of values, then both
        "explicit_bounds" and "bucket counts" fields must be defined.
        If the histogram does not contain the distribution of values, then both
        "explicit_bounds" and "bucket_counts" must be omitted and only "count" and
        "sum" are known.

        The data model and relation between entities is shown in the
        diagram below. Here, "DataPoint" is the term used to refer to any
        one of the specific data point value types, and "points" is the term used
        to refer to any one of the lists of points contained in the Metric.

        - Metric is composed of a metadata and data.
        - Metadata part contains a name, description, unit.
        - Data is one of the possible types (Sum, Gauge, Histogram, Summary).
        - DataPoint contains timestamps, attributes, and one of the possible value type
          fields.

        Each distinct type of DataPoint represents the output of a specific
        aggregation function, the result of applying the DataPoint's
        associated function of to one or more measurements.

        All DataPoint types have three common fields:
        - Attributes includes key-value pairs associated with the data point
        - TimeUnixNano is required, set to the end time of the aggregation
        - StartTimeUnixNano is optional, but strongly encouraged for DataPoints
          having an AggregationTemporality field, as discussed below.

        Both TimeUnixNano and StartTimeUnixNano values are expressed as
        UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

        # TimeUnixNano

        This field is required, having consistent interpretation across
        DataPoint types.  TimeUnixNano is the moment corresponding to when
        the data point's aggregate value was captured.

        Data points with the 0 value for TimeUnixNano SHOULD be rejected
        by consumers.

        # StartTimeUnixNano

        StartTimeUnixNano in general allows detecting when a sequence of
        observations is unbroken.  This field indicates to consumers the
        start time for points with cumulative and delta
        AggregationTemporality, and it should be included whenever possible
        to support correct rate calculation.  Although it may be omitted
        when the start time is truly unknown, setting StartTimeUnixNano is
        strongly encouraged.
