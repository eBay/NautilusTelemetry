NautilusTelemetry is an iOS-oriented Swift package to collect [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry) data and submit it in [OTLP-JSON](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) format to an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) instance. gRPC is not currently supported in order to keep the package size as small as possible. Not all features of OpenTelemetry are supported, and this package should be considered experimental.

Additional utilities include an Swift wrapper for [os_unfair_lock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/1646466-os_unfair_lock_lock), and a wrapper for [mach_continuous_time](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1646199-mach_continuous_time) to provide precision timing.

## Usage

```swift

import NautilusTelemetry

InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(reporter: ExampleReporter())

	func logResponseComplete() {
		let tracer = InstrumentationSystem.tracer
		tracer.withSpan(name: #function) {
			self.populateLogContext()
			self.loggers.forEach { logger in
				logger.logResponseComplete()
			}
		}
	}

```
